# About Me

Hi! I'm **Jingru Fan** 👋

I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, fortunate to be guided by **Prof. Chen Qian**, whose passion, insight, and encouragement have greatly strengthened my confidence in my research journey. I also intern at **THUNLP**, where the guidance from **Prof. Huimin Chen** and **Dr. Weize Chen** has been invaluable to my growth and exploration in research.

## 🎯 Research Interests

My research focuses on **LLM-based autonomous agents** and **multi-agent systems**, with an emphasis on capability emergence, self-evolution, and robust reasoning across diverse scenarios. I also draw inspiration from cognitive science, social science, and other interdisciplinary fields to explore more principled mechanisms for agent behavior and the formation of collective intelligence.

## 💫 Life Interests

I love **music**, **photography**, **boxing**, and **exploring natural spots**! I also have an all-black cat 🐈‍⬛ （just like the GitHub icon!）
