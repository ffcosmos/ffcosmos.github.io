# About Me

Hi! I'm **Jingru Fan** 👋

I'm currently a first-year Ph.D. student at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, fortunate to supervised by **Prof. Chen Qian**, who is passionate and full of innovative ideas in research. I'm also honored to be an intern at **THUNLP**, where I continue to explore and grow under the guidance of **Prof. Huimin Chen** and **Dr. Weize Chen**.

## 🎯 Research Interests

My research focuses on **autonomous agents with LLM** and **multi-agent systems**, aiming to enable agents to think autonomously, collaborate, and make decisions like humans. Beyond that, I'm also deeply interested in **Computational Social Science** and **AI4Innovation**, and I'm fascinated by fields such as **sociology, psychology, and cognitive science**. I believe that true breakthroughs in empowering intelligence often lie at the intersection of disciplines, where countless unexplored possibilities await discovery.

## 💫 Life Interests

I enjoy **music**, **singing**, **photography**, **boxing** and **traveling to natural environments**. I also have a completely black cat 🐈‍⬛ (just like the GitHub icon!).
